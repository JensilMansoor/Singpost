            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt"><strong>Singapore, 23 September 2020</strong> - Singapore Post Limited (SingPost) today officially opened its doors to its second philatelic retail store, the Philatelic Store@Fullerton. Located at the basement floor of The Fullerton Hotel
                Singapore, the new store traces the roots of Singapore's rich postal history to the site of its very first General Post Office.
            </p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">The store was officially opened by Mr Vincent Phang, SingPost CEO for Postal Services & Singapore, together with Cavaliere Giovanni Viterale, General Manager of The Fullerton Hotels and Resorts.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">Similar to the first Philatelic Store@GPO, the new store offers both stamp collectors and overseas visitors the full range of national stamps and philately memorabilia, including a range of gifts exclusive to the new store. The store also
                features a colonial-era red pillar posting box, which has been specially restored for the new site.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">The Philatelic Store@Fullerton will also offer basic mail services, including the handling of Basic Mail, Tracked Mail and Registered Services for mailing within Singapore and internationally.
            </p>
            <h6 class="sgp-postal-revision__sub-head">Special date stamp</h6>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">Given the significance of the store to Singapore’s postal history, SingPost will offer a special commemorative date stamp at the Philatelic Store@Fullerton for collectors and customers, which can be obtained over the counter within the store.</p>

            <h6 class="sgp-postal-revision__sub-head">New Philatelic Store@Fullerton date-stamp</h6>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">Mr Phang said that the opening of the store at the former site of Singapore’s first General Post Office is of great significance to SingPost.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">"We have a rich history of over 160 years connecting communities across the country and with the rest of the world. To be able to once again make our presence at the former site of our beloved Grand Old Dame The General Post Office, we are
                hopeful that this store will be able to bring meaning for visitors and philatelic enthusiasts alike as they discover the legacy of The Fullerton Hotel in Singapore,s postal history," Mr Phang said.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">Cavaliere Giovanni said: "Once home to Singapore's General Post Office, The Fullerton Hotel Singapore is excited to welcome the opening of the Philatelic Store@Fullerton. As custodian of Singapore,s 71st National Monument, we look forward
                to creating more stories and memories to add to the rich heritage of the Fullerton Building."</p>
            <h6 class="sgp-postal-revision__sub-head">Singapore's first General Post Office</h6>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">Singapore's very first General Post Office (GPO) was situated near the Town Hall along Singapore River back in the 1800s, and subsequently moved several times to bigger buildings within the city centre as its operations grew larger. In 1925,
                the buildings were demolished to make way for the construction of Fullerton Building, where the postal service was then located.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">The GPO became Fullerton Building's anchor tenant when the building first opened in 1928, occupying the building's sub-ground, ground and first floors for its operations, including postal halls, offices and sorting rooms.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">One interesting fact of the first GPO was that mail that was dropped into the post box used to fall directly to the sub-ground floor, where it was caught on a band conveyor, which carried the mail to the sorting room. The sub-ground floor
                was also connected underground to the Post Office Pier, for the transfer and pick up of overseas mail.</p>
            <p class="sgp-postal-revision__txt">By 1971, GPO relocated its operations as it outgrew its base. The Fullerton Building continued to have an illustrious history serving as home to other government offices through the years. In 2000, the neo-classical building was transformed
                into The Fullerton Hotel Singapore as it’s known today, a luxurious 400-room heritage hotel.</p>
